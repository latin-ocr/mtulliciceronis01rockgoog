8 GENERAL INTRODUCTION.

wealth of illustration so abundantly displayed in his maturer ’
works. Το oratory and law he devoted himself with the utmost
eagerness, both from his natural fondness for these subjects, and
because he saw the possibility of winning by eloquence and skill
as an advocate the leadership in Rome which others had acquired
through valor and success on the field of battle. A brief experi-
ence in military affairs, however, formed part of his early train-

⁷ ing, for at the age of seventeen he served through one campaign
in the Social War.

Cicero’s genuine enthusiasm in his studies prompted him to
tireless activity in their pursuit and to the adoption of the most
thorough and practical methods known to his day. Actors, ora
tors, rhetorioians, and philosophers were his teachers. The
principles of their instruction he put in practice in declamation,
debate, and composition, in both Greek and Latin. The success ’
of his later years was no mere accident, nor was it the manifesta—
tion of brilliant genius, untrained and untaught,—i was rather
the natural result of the most painstaking and persistent toil.
The whole sonl of theman was aglow with the fire of learning.
Every opportunity to secure enlarged intellectual growth and
development was eagerly seized.

In the school, the lecture-roam, the courts, and the Forum he
was an interested observer and an eager learner. Books and
men, history and life, were the objects of his study. Whatever
he acquired be tested for himself and used for the enlightenment
of his fellows, always actuated by an irresistible desire to obtain
the clear light of truth and t0 illumina others with its brightness.

Like his rival for the p'alm of eloquenee among the ancients, the
renowned orator of the Greeks, he succeeded chiefly by his
remarkable application to work and his untiring effort to realize
a high ideal. Of the two masters of forensia speech, Cicero was
the broader intellectually, while Demosthenes was more impres-
sive as a speaker, carrying conviction osttimes as much by the
weight of his character as by the force of his words.
