Tur text oi this edition of Otcero De Senectute is substantially
that oi Ο. F. W. Mdller (Leipsic, 1879). The few deviatione
from his reading are stated on p. 152, and discussed in the sup
plementary notes. A different punctuation has been adopted in
some passages, and'in a fevv words the orthography has been
corrected to conform to Brambach.

The De Senectute is usually given aplane in the early part
of the college course, when training in the reading of the Latin
is imperatively needed. To assist the student in acquiring greater
accuracy in pronunciation, the long vowels in the text have been
marked. In this Levis has been taken as a guide. and both his
Lutto Dictionury sor Schools and his Elenteutury Lutto Dictionury
have been consulted. It is earnestly hoped that this feature may
be welcomed by teachers‚ and may prove to be oi practica] value.
It must be remernbered, however, that absolute accuracy in mark-
ing quantities is out of the questioh.

The Introduction has been made somewhat full in order to
present, in convenient form, asketch of Cicero's life, with a brief
account oi what he has accomplished in literature, and more
especially in philosophy. In the preparation oi the sections
which bear upon his standing as aphilosopher and his relation

to the leading schools, Mayor's admirable Sketclr os Greek Plu'loso
phy has been very helpful. “

Cicero's defense oi old age is so charmingv in style and so

¹ interesting in subjectrnatter that it deserves something inore by

way of commentary than mere discussion of grammatica] and
