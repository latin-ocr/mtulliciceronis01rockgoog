instruction from the most eminent exponnders of the doctrines of these
schools, he had roamed over the whole field of Greek philosophy and
' made himself familiar with all that had been accomplished in this
department of intellectual activity. In spite of his fondness for the
subject, however, he was not an original thinker, nor did he attempt
to establish a system or found a school of his own. His mission lay
in making known to his countrymen what had been wrought out hy
the Greeks. Taking their works as abasis and adapting them to Rornan
needs, he discussed, in popular style, the vital questions pertaining to ’
man's existence, and laid down principles of action and rules of conduct
which approach very closely at many points to the highest Christian
standard.

So far as adherence to any system is concerned‚ Cicero was an inde·
pendent, or more correctly, an eclectic. In speculative philosophy he
accepted the doctrine of the New Academy, which holds a high degree
of probability as alone attainable in human knowledge, regarding abso
luto certainty as beyond the domain of man's reason. In ethius he
agreed with the Stoics and Peripatetics on their common ground: that
virtue is the highest good, and that life in acoordance with nature or
right reason, is the perfectiori of duty. In his view of external good, he
wavered between the severe logio of the Stoics, who affirmed that it was
a matter of indifference, and the less dogmatic reasoning of the Peri-
patetics, who ascribed some value and importance to it, while holding
that it must never be made the sole object of man's desire. Epicurean-
ism received no favor at the hands of Cicero. Its passive doctrines of
ease and contentrnent could have no charin for one who found his
greatest enJ'oyment, either in the varied excitement and manifold duties
of ¹public office, or in the most intense intellectual activity.

Cicero’s independenoe and eclecticism led him to expound and com-
pare opposing views and conflicting¹ systems. This fact has resulted
greatly to our advantage in enlarging our horizon and making us ac-
quainted with muchin the history of philosophy that must otherwise

have remained unknown to us. The value of his achievenrents in this =

particular to the Romans can hardly be overestimated. To thern he
disclosed the choicest treasures and the most ennobling products of
Greek thought, and made intelligible by translation, by definition, and
practical illustration, truths aud sentimenta to which they had hitherto
been strangers.
