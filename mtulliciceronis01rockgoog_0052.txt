a oppomflon to Antony-But Cicero was not destined to
close his life in the peaceful retirement of the scholar. Still
sturmier scenos awaited him than any through which he had yet
passed. The murder of Caesar on the Ides of March, 44 nc,
was but the renewal of strife and bloodshed that were destined
to end only with the founding of the new Empire. Cicero's first
impulse was to seek personal safety in Greece3 but though he
commenced the journey, he quickly changed his course and
repaired to Rome in the earnest belief that the senatorial party
would ultimately prewail. The closing year of his life was filled
with stirring events. He became the leader of the senate and
people, and bent all his energies to the establishment of peace
on a secure basis and the rehabilitation of the government on its
former lines. Looking upon Antony as a dangerous foe to the
state, he attached him in those fiery invectivus known as the
Philippica. But the temporary success of the consuls over
Antony at Mutina and the ceaseless efforts which Cicero made
to strengthen the hands of the constitutional party in the city
and provinces failed to revive the ancient spirit and to restore
the liberties of the people,

Octavianus, at the head of his legions, forced his own election
tu the consulship, although but nincteen years of age, and then,
uniting with Antony and Lepidus in the formation of the second
triumvirate, shattered the hopes of all who had fondly dreamcd
that the golden age of the Republic was about to return. 'l'he
current was, in fact, setting in the other direction, and a stronger
arm and stouter beart than Cicero's would have been powerless
before it. Complete success for the three sslf-appointed lords of
Rome was possible only by the destruction of their personal foes
and the death of every leader of the opposition. Accordingly,
the proscription of Sulla was renewed, and Ciceroâ€™s name was

placed by Antony's command on the list of those to be destroyed.
