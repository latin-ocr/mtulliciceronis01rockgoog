28 GENERAL INTRODUCTION.

ples of eminent Greeks and Romans who preserved their vigor,
military prowess, cornrnanding influence in state affairs, literary
skill, poetic inspiration, or philosophical acuteness far beyond
nran's allotted ageos three scorc and ten. Oicero’s wide acquaint-
ance with literature and history made it an easy task for him to
marshal the hosts of ancient worthies in support of his argu-
ments. Besides this, in the simpler matter ol form and arrange·
menthe has displayed his best characteristics and made his work
worthy ol the most careful study. Sentence order based upon
emphasis, pleonasm for rhetorical effect, anaphora with its result-
ing force and brevity, and, including all other excellenceS, the
well-rounded period, so stately in its rnovement, and so irnpressive
to the Roman mind, are exemplified in this essay in the well-nigh
faultless style of the greatest master of the Latin tongue. For
more than eighteen centurias the De Senectute has been read and
admired‚ a fact sufficient in itself to prove its beauty of expression
and depth of meaning.

28. philosophical Vama-In its philosophical import it is to
be regarded as an ethical treatise written for a definite, practical
purpose, to help his friend Atticus and all who might read it, to
bear the ills and burdens of life's elosing period with becoming
dignity and manly courage. Educated Romans had already lost
faith in the corrupt and fanciful religione beliefs of their fathers,
Lest they be tempted to yield ultimately to despair or to plunge
into the mire of vice and immorality, the noblest minds sought
refuge in the teachings of philosophy. For such, Cicero's moral
treatises were full of comfort and inspiration. He delighted to
draw his illustratione from the best years of his country’s his-
tory, and to commend in earnest terrns the simple virtues and
temperate lives of Fabricius Curius, and the men of their day.
By such exanrples hc sought to revive in the hearts of his follow-
citizens the ancient spirit of patriotism, which shrank from no
sacrifice, even that of life itself, in defense of the honor and
liberties of Rome.
