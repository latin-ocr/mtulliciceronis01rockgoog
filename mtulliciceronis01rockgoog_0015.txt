worlm. 'lo oratory and law be devoted himself with the utmost
ormontem, botb from his natural fondness for these subjecta, and
boarum be suw tbc possibility of winning by eloquenoe and skill
as rur rirlvocatc the lealcrship in Rome which others hadacquired
tbrougb valor arrd success on the field of battle. A brief experi-
cncc iu military affairs, however, formed part of his early train-
iug, lor at the age of seventeen he served- through one campaign

Cicero’s genuine enthusiasm in bis studies prompted him to
tireless activity in their pursuit and to the adoption of the most
tborougb and practical methods known to his day. Actors, ora·
tore, rlretoricianS, and philosophers were his teachers. The
principles ot their instruction he put in practice iu declamation,
(lebate, and composition, in both Greek and Latin. The success '
ol bis luter years was no mere accident, nor was it tha manifesta
tion ol brilliant genius, untrained aud untaught,—it was rather

tbo natural result of the most painstaking and persistent toil.
'l'be whole soul of the man was aglow with the fire of learning.
Every opportunity to secure cularged intellectual grcwth and
development was sagerly seized.

ln the school, the lecture-room, the courtS, and the Forum he

was an interested observet and an eager learner. Books and
men, history and life, were the objeots of his study. Whatever
he acquired he tested for himself and used for the enlightanment
of his fellows, always actuated by an irresistlble desire to obtain
the clear light of tmth aud tc illumine others with its brightness.
Like his rival for the p'alm of eloquence among the ancients, the
renowned orator of the Greeks, he succeeded chiefly by his
remarkable applicaticn to work and his untiring affort to realize
a high ideal. of the two masters of forensia speech, Cicero was
the broader intellectually, while Demosthenes was more impres-
sive as a speaker, carrying conviction cittimes as much hythe
weight of his character as by the force of his words.
