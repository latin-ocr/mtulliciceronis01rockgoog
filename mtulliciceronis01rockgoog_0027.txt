GENERAL INTRODUCTION.

omanus WORKS.

14. orationa— Fifty-seven orations ascribed to Cicero are now ex-
tant, oi which some are incompleta, and four or five may possibly bc
spurious. We have fragments ot about twenty more, aad know the titles
of thirty-three others. -

15. Lattara-More than eight hundred of Cicero's letters have
been preserved. Thesauro divided as follows:—

Epistulae ad Familiares, 16 Books.
Epistulae ad Atticum, 16 Books.
Epistulae od Quintum Fratrem, 3 Books.
Epistulae ad M. Brutum, 2 Books.

16. Poenae—Only fragments of Cicero’s poetical works romain.
These give evidence ot skill in versification, but are lacking in poetic
inspiration. Most of them belong to his earlier years3 they were often
mere youlhful exemistis, or translations from the Greek. Cicero wrote a
nretrioal account ot his own consulship, in three books, of which about
eighty lines are still preserved. He also wrote a poem entitled De Meis
Temporibus, supposed to have been a continuation of the poem on his
consulship.
