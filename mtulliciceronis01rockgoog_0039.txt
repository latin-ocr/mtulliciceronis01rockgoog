32 GENERAL INTRODUCTION.

Scipio's death occurred 1:29 rac, under very suspicions circumstances.
After making vigorous opposition in the senate to some'of the provisions
of the agrarian laws of Gracchus he was conducted to his home by
senators and lauded proprietors of the Italian allies, who shewed iu this
manner their appreciation of his bold stand in edvocating their iuterests
against the demands of the reformers. On the following morning he
was found dead on his couch. The true story of his death still remains
a mystery. Many suspected foul play, and openly charged Carbo, one
of the leaders of the Gracchan party, with the crime of murder. His
subsequcnt suicide gave strong ground for belief in his guilt‚ but the
accusation· was never substantiated by legal proof.

Scipio, like his lifelong companion‚ Laelius was a man of great cul·

cultivation of the ennobling arts of peace aud his generous patronage of
the famous “ Scipionic Circle,'' cornposed of the most eulightened authors

in the De Senectute, but a brief sketch of the man will be appropriate at
this point and will help to a clearer understanding of the text. It must
be borne in mind that Cicero did not select Cato as the principal speaker
in the dialogus in the belief that he was in all respects an ideal person,
but rather on account of the integrity, the physical vigor, and the intel·
lectual activity which he manifested in extreme old age, and that in the
progressos the work he found it necessary to remodel Cato's character
to smne extent, softening its harsh features, rounding oif the sharp cor-
ner-s and imparting to it more refinement and culture than ever actually
marked the stern old Censor.

Marcus Porcius Ceto belonged to a plebeian family of Sabine stock
and was born at Tusculum, 234 nc. Though we know little of his early
years yet we may reasonably conclude that he received the best treining
in law aud oratory afforded by his native town and the neighboring city
of Rome. The plain, austere life of the hardy Sabines seems to have
