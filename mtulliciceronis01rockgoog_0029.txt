22 GENERAL INTRODUCTION.

It is favorable to Cicero, but not blindly partisan. Middleton’s book is
old and highly eulogistio, hut not without merit. Smith’s dictionary
contains an interesting sketch of the orator, together with a complete
list of his works. The article is especially convenient for reference.
‘l'rollope's life is attractive in style, and bold in Cicero's defense. It
brings out his personal characteristios in a virid manner. Watson's
edition of select letters includes usefnl tables introductions, and dis·
cussions. lt is avaluable help to the study of Cicero’s life as revealed
in his correspondence.

Leighton’s history is well written and ambitione in plan. It is well
supplied with convenient summaries and illustrative material. Liddell
has long maintained its hold ou popular favor. The author seelrs to
treat Cicero fairly. Merivale’s larger work is a recognized authority on
the history of Rome from the fall of the Republic to the ago oi the
Antonines. The Roman Triumvirates is a smaller work of the saure

author. Merivale gives due prominenoe to Cicero and recognizes his
strong as well as weak points. Mommsen’s history is devoted to the
growth and development of the State. It is a work of great value‚ but
its conclusions are sometimes based upon speculation and not upon well-
established evidence. Mommsen is exceedingly harsh in his treatment of

Cicero. N iebuhr’s Rome marked an epoch in historical studies. It was
an attempt to demolish the old record and construet a new one. The
lecturos were published after his death from fragmentary notes, and are
of less irnportanoe than the history.
