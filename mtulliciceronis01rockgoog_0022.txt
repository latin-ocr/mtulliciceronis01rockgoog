in his ambitione struggle for absolute power, and his impotency
in the presence of an unscrnpulous tyrant like Antony, were as
clearly apparent to Cicero himself as they can now bo to any
of his detractors.

10. Servios to meratina-But it is to his work in the realm
of letters that we can turn with the greatest satisfaction. As an
orator he is without a peer in the annals of Rome aud second
iu the whole world. In literature and philosophy he has fulfilled
the words of Horace, and “reared a monument more enduring
than bronze, loftier than the pyramide, those moldering relies
of old kings.’' To estimate his services to the Latin tongue
would be indeed a difficult task. Subsequent writers found in
him a model of elegance and good taste. ¹If we could annihilato
his influence upon Roman letters, blot his own works out of
existence, and close forever their rich storehouse of history,
literature, and philosophy, we might gain by way of contrast·
some conception of the service he rendered his age and the real
value of the contribution he made to the world's literature.
But in modern times we are under greatest obligation to Cicero
for bringing to our knowledge, through the medium of his own
works, the highest conclusione, embodied in the teaohings and
speculatione of Greek philosophy, reached by the human intelleot
alone, in its attempt to determine the duty and destiny oi man.
