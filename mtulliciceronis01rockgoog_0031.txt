Basel‚ 1524; edited by Hess, Halle, 1833.

Sir J ohn Denham (1615-1668) published a metrical version in English.

Beesly’s work, a collection oi review essays, contains a seyere arraign·
ment oi Cicero. Boissier gives a charming account oi Cicero and his
friends The works oi Church and Collins are popular in character, the
latter designed especially ior those who cannot read Latin. Dyer describes
in brief compass the growth and development oi the city, and relates the
story oi its famous monuments. Fowler’s Caesar is an entertaining
slretch prepared ior the general reader. It sets forth Cicero's relatione
with Caesar. Fronde regards Caesar as the one man ior his time, and
looks upon Cicero as a strange mixture oi strength and weakness.
Landor’s imaginary conversations, aiter the manner oi Plato, give one a
familiar acquaintance with the personages involved. Lord’s book is in
popular vein, entertaining in matter and style. Napoleon ΙΙΙ. made an
elaborate attempt to defend Caesar. Montesquieu's is an old but valu-
able work.

The lists given above are not intended to be complete, but simply
suggestive.
