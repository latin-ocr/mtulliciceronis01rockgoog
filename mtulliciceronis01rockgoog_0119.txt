increasing power of Antony and the uncertainty as to his ultimate designa.

G. 5133 B. 268,6; it. 1751.

cui qui. . . possit: equivalent to cam is, qni ei pareat. . . possit.
Note the juxtaposition oi the two relatives. possit is a subjunctive oi cause
or reason. It gives the reason ior the very strong statement in the preced-
ing sentence, Numquam. . . poterit. pareat depends upon possit and is
attracted into the same mood. This seems to me the best explanation of
the construction, and it is the one given by most editors. Reid, however,
regards cni as simply connective, = et ei, and qai pereat . . . clepere asa
conditional sentence of irreguiar form (qni = siquis).
