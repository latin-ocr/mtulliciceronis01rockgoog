narentur, and treats them ior the moment as involving but one idea; namely‚
the hard lot of old age.

accideret . . . venirent: observe the mood and tense.

r’rsr’r: aaa venire, tc cometa expetierim, i.e. to hoppen, to occur. Some
editors think usu may be a predicative dative. Roby, 1238, regards it as an
ablative of manner. For the numerous instanees of this expression in*
Cicero, see Harpers’ Lat. Lex. s.v. risus, 11.c. 2.

querum . . . querela: aad yet I have obsereed that the old cpe os many
os them is free stom eornpteint. The phrase siae querela has the force oi an
adjective. The prepositions eant and siae are frequently used in such attrib-
utive expressions.

qui . . . terrent: subjunctive oi characteristic.

ndn moleste: litotes, not itt, i.e. pretty, libenter. Instead of the usual
aee . . . nee, the first connective is divided into et . . . aoa; this throws
the force of the negative particle on moleste.

8. sed idrtaeee dixerit quispiam: bct perhaps some cae may say. Thm
this may be taken as the meaning oi the Latin is perlectly apparent ; the
exact construction ci dixerit, however, isa mooted question. Many editors
regard it as a potential subjunctive, in which the perfect has practically the
same force as the present. Roby‚ vol. 11. Prei. pp. 101-106, alter a careful
consideration of the subject, inclines strongly to the opinion that the verb is
future perfect indicative.

opes: triticeam, in the state.

cdpiis: wealth.

dignitatem: recle, triph sociat standing.

tolerabllldrem: observe the passive force oi this verbal adjective, “that
which can be endured.”

9. omnino: certainty.

arma: desecatae weapoaa.

senectutis: subjective genitive.

artes exercitationesque virtutum: knowledge arrd qood deecit. With
artes sc. liberales. But Cicero has especially in mind the effect cf artes
liberates or optimae in giving one kitowledpe and intellectuat power.

cultae: the participle has a conditional force, is cultivated.

cum . . . vixeris: for this use of the subjunctive in a general condition,
see 6024 (tls, 2); A. 309, α ; G. 595, 3; B. 356, 3 ; L. 2110.
