THE DE SENECTUTE. 29

But Cicero’s message, uttered by the lips of Cato, was not lirn-
ited to the men ol his own time merely. The truths which he
proclaimed were as broad in their meaning and as wide in their
application as humanity itself. Emerson, in his essay on Old
Age, thus bears witness to the enduring value and suggestive
force of Cicero’s work: “The speech led me to look over at
horne Cicero’s famous essay, charming by its uniform rhetorical
merit3 heroic with Stoieal precepts3 with a Roman eye to the
olaims of the state; happiest, perhaps, in his praise of life on

. the farm, aud rising at the conclusion to a lofty strain. But he

does not exhaust the subject3 rather invites the attempt to add
traits to the picture from our broader modern life.'' of its lit
erary excellence and soundness in doctrine, the late Professor
Lincolu thus speaks: “I have been impressed more than ever
before with the worth of this Latin essay, in the justness
of its sentirnents and in the finish of its diction. The tone is
cheerfnl and genial, and yet calm and serious3 the argument for
age moves on at times with a moderate concession, but mostly
witha happy ingenuity and glowiug fervor of defense. Itis
Roman in its good sense and sober, practioal spirit3 it is Cice·
ronian in the fullness and richness of its ideas and illustratione,

auditis human and humane in all its views of man's life and
destiny.’' (In Memoriam, J. L. Ia, p. 524.)

praetor, augur, and consul, the last in the year 140 rao. In the fieres
struggle at the capture and destruction of Carthago, he was second in
command to Scipio, and displayed remarkable skill and bravery. As a
patron of literature he was even more distinguished than in the capacity
of statesman or general. Well trained in oratory, law, and philosophy,
