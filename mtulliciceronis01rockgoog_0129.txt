more 10 the safety of the others.

miles . . . cdneul: see Introduction, p. 33. Note the repetition of the
connective.
Ι genere: note the use 01 the singular where the English idiom requires
the plural.

male. . . cogitanti: treacaemasly plottiay. A

¹iam diu . . . multe ante: the first expression emphasizes the continu-
ance of the plotting; the second shows that Cato began 1ο urge war against
Carthage long before it was officially declared. The present indecentia

tertius . . . tricesimus: all the MSS. heve tertias, which puts Scipio’s
death in 183 rac , and so agrees with Livy, XXXIX. 19. 10 ; but since this
conflicts with the statement Anac ante nte cettscrem and also with nocem
cartis post . . . consulatum, for Cato was consul 195 and censor 181 aa,
some editors read scalas or quintus, making 185 rac. the date 01 his death.
This will remove the discrepancy‚ bnt involves a change in the text. The
numbers VI. and lll. might easily be confused by a copyist.

lterum: to be taken with consul creatas est, elected coasal sor tlte second
tinae, which would make his election fall 111 the year 195 and his term 01
office 191 no.
