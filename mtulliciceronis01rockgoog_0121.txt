sio: ito might have been employed, but sic, as a correlative to 1110 1011011-
ing ut, is more emphatic. ι

Quibus: the dative oi possession.

enim: certainty, asin j 1.

110110 beateque vivendum: o pure ond happy lise. Cf. De Fiu. V. 29, 88,
Νο0 dubitatum quia ia uirtute 0111010, 111 bene, nicetium beate vivendi spes
poneretur.

ipsi: observo that 1110 (10110101101110 10 made to agree with the subject,

adterat: subjunctive 01 characteristic, see 591, 1 (508, Ι.); M. 3833
A. 320; (16111, 2; B. 283; L. 1821. Some 01111010, however, regard quod
as equal 10 si id, and the subjunctive as conditional.

Quo in genere: 11010 the order. A monosyllabic proposition is often
thus placed between a qualifying word and its noun, as quoni ob rem, 11100110
curn laude.

ut. . . adeptam: chiastic arrangement. The reading adeptam is not
certain. Some MSS. and many editions have adepti, but the meaning is
010011001111100011101110111101 case. The objection to adeptum, that Cicero
nowhere else uses it in the passive, is not conclusive, from the iact that he
does sometimes employ the perfect participle 01 other deponent verbs in the
passive, and Sallust, 0111, VII. 3, has adepto libertate,· Tacitus, Aua. I. 1, 8,
adepto principatu.

Praeterita enim: enim is here explicative. See on I. 1.

quamvis longa: ltotoever 10110.

cum effluxisset: the subjunctive is used because the clause depends ·
upon posset. ’1110 case is a supposed one, and cuna has practically the 10100
oiri, tf.

cdnsblatibz this is the reading of the best MSS. Many editors prefer
to follow inferior MSS, and read retractatione.
