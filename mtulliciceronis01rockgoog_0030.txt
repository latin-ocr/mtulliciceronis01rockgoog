BOOKS OF REFERENCE. 23

Tunrsst: History os Roman Literature. English translation.
Wrrnrrs: Primer os Roman Lilerolure.

Bender’s history and Wilhins’s primer are brief but well written com·
penrliums, designed to give the student an outline oi Roman literature.
The works oi Cruttwell and Simoeis, the latter in two volumeS, are much
broader iu scope aud better suited to the wants of the general reader.

Cruttwell’s is a good handboolr3 Simcox is more proiound and scholarly. ,

Teuffel’s history, in two volumes, is especially valuable ior reference. lt
contains an immense amount oi material and is absolutely indispensable
to the scholar, but is not intended ior general reading.

Butler's lecturas contain a readable exposition oi the principles cf
Greek philosophy, together with accounts oi the different schools and
their founders. Mayor’s shetch is excellent ior a briei presentation.
Ritter’s history is a comprehensive work, invaluable for reference. The
author gives a minute statement of Cicero’s philosophy, and points out
clearly the nature and value oi the service rendered by him to Roman
thought. Schwegler is clear in the statement oi general principles but
not very thorough in the discussion oi doctrines. Zeller shows the
results oi critical research and accurate scholarship. lllorris’s translation
oi Ueberweg, with additions by Porter, is, perhaps, superior in practical
value to any other history oi philosophy. Its bibliographical information
is an important feature.
