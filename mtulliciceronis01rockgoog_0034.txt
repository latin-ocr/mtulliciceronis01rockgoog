THE DE SENECTUTE. 27

while his excellent judgment and scholarly taste enabled him to
assist his friend with practical suggestions and wiso criticisms.
When the De Senectute was completed, Atticus had already
reached the age of sixty-five. It was eminently fitting, there-
fore, that Oicero should inscribe his essay 00 Old Age 10 him, and
bestow this mark of honor upon afriend of such long standing,
upou one, in fact, who had been alihe the sharer of his youthsnl
joys and the trusted companion of his riper age. It was Atticus’
fortune, as the sequel proved, to survive the author ten years and'
test 10 his own experience the ingenious reasoning employed by
his friend in his charming defense 01 life's declining years.

26. Greek sources—In the composition 01 the De Senectute,
Cicero occasionally borrowed from Plato’s Republic 0011Χοοο-
Α phon's Oeconomicus and Oyropaedia. The arguments which he
gives for the immortality of the soul he simply repeats in suh

10 Aristo of Oeos certainly indicates that he was acquainted with
a treatise on Old Age by that author. But whether he drew
from this 10 any great extent or not we are unable 10 determine,
for Aristo's work has not corne down to us. Cicero makes no
attempt to conceal his indebtedness 10 1110 Greeks. On the other
hand, he frequently mentions his authorities for the purpose of
strengthening and enforcing his point. In dealing with the orig-
inals he sometimes follows the text closely, and sometimes trans·

lates with greater freedom, often varying the minor features of an -

illustration in order 10 give it amore pronouuced Roman ooloring.

27. Literary character. - As aliterary production 111οΟ080000-
tute has deserved and won the highest praise. Cicero was preemi-
nently a master 01 style, and in this treatise, in the composition
of which he evidently took genuine delight, we see him at his
best. The dialogus form made lively, animated discoursa, easy
of attaiumeot, while the special line of argument employed pre-
pared the way for apt and foroible illustrations. One by one the
supposed charges against Old Age are reviewed and met by exarn-
