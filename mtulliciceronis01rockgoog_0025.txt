18 GENERAL INTRODUCTION.

Alter a century or more oi such fruitless speculation and vague
discussion and theorizing, a natural reaction occurred, and the Sophiste
appeared upon the stage. Protesting against such profitless use ol mental
energy, they boldly declared their scepticism in regard to absolute truth,
and sought to turn logio and philosophy to practical account in acquiring
wealth and distinction lor themselves. But a more important advance
was made in the history of man's intellectual development by the
advent in the philosophical world of Socrates (469-399 Β.ο.), who fur·
nished inspiration, directly or indirectly, to all later schools of Greek
thought. llis appearance marked the dawn of a new era. It was
his special mission to turn men’s thoughts from physical to ethical truth,

12. schools ol Philosophy ln Cicero's Time-In Cicero’s time
there were four leading schools ol philosophy, the Academic, Peripa·

who taught in a painted perch, or stoa, began in 308 rac. to proclaim the
new philosophy, designed to meet this special want, and boldly asserted
that man’s highest duty consists in living in accordance with nature.
Only a few years later, Epicurus appeared in his garden in Athens as
the expouuder of still another doctrine whose special object it was to
liberate men from all groundless fears and enable them to live happy
and contented lives. According to the distinctive tenet oi this system,
pleasure is the highest good3 it should be remembered, however, that
the term as used by Epicurus signified pleasure in its purest and best
sense.

13. Steuding as a philosopher-Cicero was personally acquainted
