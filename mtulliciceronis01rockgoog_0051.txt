12 GENERAL INTRODUCTION.

was about to break forth. Cicerc’s ideal was the old Republic.
It was impossible for him tc turn with enthusiasm and hope
either 11 Caesar 11 to Pompey. The course which 111 adopted
seems weak and vacillating because he was compelled 1ο choose
between two evils and found it exceedingly difficult to decide
which was the less. He was undoubtedly mistaken in judgment
on many pointS, and blind to the true condition of the times.
He failed to realize that the former order of‘things 1111111111-
ecably changed, that old forms of government had lost their
force, and that, unless there should be a complete regeneration

11 the scholar’s spirit and a larger measure cf 1111 philosopher’s
consolation and hope. Withdrawing from public gaze, he found

colace in the contemplation 11 truth and inspiration in the
ennobling pursuit of letters. Devoting himself in this time of
political distress and confusion 11 the composition 11 his noblest
works, he brought forth the ripened fruit of years 11 laborious
study, and handed down 11 the scholare 11 all time the priceless
