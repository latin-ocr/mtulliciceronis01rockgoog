Tnn text of this edition of Cicero De Senectute is substantially
that of C. F. W. Muller (Leipsic, 1879). The few deviatione
from his reading are stated on p. 152, and discussed in the sup
plementary notes. A different punctuation has been adopted in
some passages and'in a iew words the orthography has been
corrected to conform to Brambach.

The De Senectute is usually given a place in the early part
of the college course, when training in the reading of the Latin
is imperatively needed. To assist the student in acquiring greater
accuracy in pronunciation, the long vowels in the text have been
marked. In this Lewis has been taken as a guido, and both his
Lutc‘n Dictioucry for Sclroolc and his Elcmcntucy Latin Dictioncny
have been consulted. It is earnestly hoped that this feature may
be welcomed by teachers, and may prove to be of practica] value.
It must be remembered, however, that absolute accuracy in mark-
ing quantities is out of the question.

The Introduction has been made somewhat full in order to
present, in convenient forrn, a sketch of Cicero’s life, with abrici
account of what he, has accomplished in literature, and more
especially in philosophy. In the preparation oi the sections
which bear upon his standing as a philosopher and his relation
to the leading schools, Mayor’s admirable Slcetclt of Greek Pln’loso
play has been very helpful. ·

Cicero's defense oi old age is so charming in style and so

’ interesting in subjectrnatter that it deserves something ruore by
way ol commentary than mere discussion of grammatical and
