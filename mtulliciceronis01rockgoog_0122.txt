SECTION S 5-6.

posset: for the mood, see on esset, Ι. 3.

5. quae: see on qni, Ι. 3.

esset: this isa more modest form of wish than atinam sit. The imper·
fect implies that Cato does not think his wlsdom worthy of their admiration.

tamquam deum: the masculine is here used in the generic sense, ο divine
being. Cf. sen. Ben. IV. 7, 1, Quid enim uliud eet natura quam deus et
divina ratio toti araride pertibus eius inserte.

itque: equivalent to ab ea em'm,· the reference is to Nature, which is
here personified.

aetatis: employed in the sense oi citae.

descriptae: some editors prefer discriptae, for which there is also MS.
authority, but descriptae, written ont, seems ιο harmoniae better with the
context than discriptae, assigned. - Reid.

inerti: indoleat.

luit: ie. it was and always will be. It is according tothe natureof things.

aliquid extremum: something final.

bacis . . . hictibus: note the difference in the meaning of these words,
here distinctly brought out by the genitivos arborum and terrae.
’ vietum: vimen and eltis have also the same root.

caducum: ready ιο sall,· derived from cado.

quod: but iliis. The leading thought is really found in this clause.

ferundum: for this form, instead of fereadum, see 24³ (289); M. 101, 6;

molliter: eritb submissioa. [A. 126, f. n. 23 G. 130, 8; B. 116, 23 L. 899.

Gigantum: see on Aetna previus, p. 48. For ubet else bnt resistiny
auterre is equitatem ιο fighting ae tlte pionte did oycirrst tbe gods? The
English arrangement of the clauses differs somewhat from the Latin. How-
son gives a very concise rendering, ‘⁶ Rebellion against nature ls nothing else
but war with the gods.’'

6. Atqui: Reid translates, Trete, but. Atqui is here used ιο confirm the
preceding statement, and also to add another point to the argument.

nobie: explained hythe clause, ut . . . pollicear.

pollicear: ιο promise. The principal clause, on which the final clause ·
depends, may sometimes be omitted, as in this instance. Itmust then be
inferred from the context.

feceris . . . didicerimus: future perfect tense, where the English would
employ the simple future. In place of didicerimus, Gernhard suggested that
si nos docereris, is you ebali bave taurim as, would have been more natural
after seceris. 'l'he change was probably rnade because didicerimus puts the
statement, which is practically a request, in a milder way, and also harmonizes
with the intervening forms, speramus and roiurrme.
