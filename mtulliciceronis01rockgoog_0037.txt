30 GENERAL INTRODUCTION.

” of his time. To his home carne Pacuvius, Terence, Lucilius, Scaevola,
· and rnen of similar testes, and together they studied the best authors or

’ discussed the profoundest questions iu philosophy. From this group

of scholarly men radiated an iufluence beneficial to the interests of
learning and culture in Rome. To this company, too, belonged Scipio,
in whom Laelius found a kindred soul and a never-failing friend.
Though the younger Africanus received more ample civil and military
honora, yet he willingly yielded the palm to laelius as a man of letters
and a patron of scholars. For years these distinguished leaders, the
best products of Roman civilization‚ alilrc the ornament and the defense
of the state, shared their burdens and their pleasures. Of the noted

friendships of antiquity, none surpasses that of Laelius and Scipio in
siucerity aud unselflshnesa or in nobility of aim and purity of purpose.
When Cicero wrote his De Amicitia, he selected Laelius as best qualilied
by experience to set forth the principles and advantages of friendship,

and eulogiae the life and character of the departed Scipio. How long

’ Laelius survived the death of the latter is not known.

(2) serpae-scipio was the son of Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus,
who defeated Perseus at Pydna, 168 rac, and thus completed the conquest
of Macedonia. He was born 185 rac, and was adopted by the eldest
son of Scipio Africanus. By virtue of this adoption, his full name
became Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus, to which was afterwards
added Africanus, iu honor of his victory over Carthage. His first expe-
rience as a soldier was gained under his father at Pydna. In the year
151 rac. he scrved as military tribune in Spain, aud won distinction by
his cnergy and persoual courage. In the Third Punic War, the Romans,
disheartened by the ill success of their generals, elected Scipio consul for
the year 147 rac, though he had not yet reached the legal age, and gave
him the chief command, in the hope that he would quiclrly terminate
the conflict, and add new lustcr to Roman arms. Their confidence was
not misplaced. In the following spring he captured the city, utterly
overthrcw the Carthaginien power, and received as his own reward a
magnificent triumph at Rome. Again, in 133 rac, he was called upon
to retrieve losses due to the mismanagement aud incorupetency of others,
and brought to a successful issue the Numantina War, which had been
prolonged‚ to the iujury and discredit of Rome, ten years. Upon his
return from this campaign, he lost the favor of the popular party by
expressing approbation of the murder of Ti. Gracchus.
