THE DE SENECTUTE. 33

suited his vigorous constitution and pleased his simple tastes, for henot
only labored in his boyhood on the paternal estate, but always mani-
fested special fondness for his country home, and nevar shrank from the
severest kind of toil known to the sturdy farmers of that rude age.

Like other young men of his time, ha rendered his first service to the
state, as asoldier in the Second Punic War‚ taking part with great credit
to himself in several important engagements, including the decisivo
battle of the Metaurus. In the year 204 ac. he was quaestor in Sicily
under Scipio. The two men were totally unlike in disposition and in
their views of public service. Cato’s vigorous opposition to what he
regarded as the unwarranted extravagance of his superior in office
resulted in the mutual hat red and open hostility which existed between
them for nearly twenty years and terminated only at Scipio's death.
Cato became aedile 199 n.c., praetor in the following year, and in 195 nc.

His colleagne in the latter office was his patron and life-long friend
Valerius Flaccus, a wealthyand powerful Roman, who had been early

and this he ruled with so much vigor, and at the same time with such

military fame. By his success in gaining the rear of the enemy by a
night march through a difficult and dangerous path, and by his sudden
attack upon the unsuspecting foe, he contributed very materially to
Glabrio’s victory at Thermopylae.

In the year 184 aa, Cato held the office of censor. It was in this
position that he gained his greatest distinction and made the force of his
personality most strikingly felt. Supported by his colleagne, his old
friend and admirer Valerius Flaccus, he at once adopted the strictest
measures to check extravagance and corruption, and tried to bring about
a complete reform in the morals of Rome. The lists of knights and
